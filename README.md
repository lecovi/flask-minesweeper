### Deviget Code Challenge

We ask that you complete the following challenge to evaluate your development skills. Please use Python to accomplish the following task.

Develop the classic game of Minesweeper: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game) - Please see the description section for how the game is set up.

The following is a list of items (prioritized from most important to least important) we wish to see:
* When a cell with no adjacent mines is revealed, all adjacent squares will be revealed (and repeat)
* Ability to 'flag' a cell with a question mark or red flag
* Alert when game is over
* Persistence. Not to lose the game if browser is closed
* Time tracking
* Ability to start a new game and preserve/resume the old ones
* Ability to select the game parameters: number of rows, columns, and mines
* Ability to support multiple users/accounts
* Design and implement an API for the game (think of a mobile app for your API)
* Nice user experience (eg avoid page reload while playing)

Deliverables we expect:
* URL where the game can be accessed and played (use any platform of your preference: heroku.com, aws.amazon.com, etc)
* Code in a public Github repo
* README file with the decisions taken and important notes
* Time you spent on the challenge

You do not need to fully complete the challenge. We suggest not to spend more than 5 hours total, which can be done over the course of 2 days.  Please make commits as often as possible and just one commit at the end.  We will evaluate the code and time spent.

What we want to see is how well you handle yourself given the time you spend on the problem, how you think, and how you prioritize when time is insufficient to solve everything.

As soon as you have submitted your solution, we will review the code and send our feedback.
